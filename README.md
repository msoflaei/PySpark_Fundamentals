# PySpark_Fundamentals

This repository contains two key files showcasing the use of PySpark for data processing and modeling:

1. **PySpark Fundamentals**:  A notebook with essential PySpark concepts, covering data manipulation, transformations, and actions. This serves as a primer for understanding PySpark's distributed data processing capabilities.
2. **Logistic Regression Model**: A PySpark-based implementation of a logistic regression (LR) model developed in Databricks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps, demonstrating PySpark's capabilities in handling large-scale machine learning workflows.
